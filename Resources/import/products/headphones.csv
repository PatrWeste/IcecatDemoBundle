Based on the acclaimed design of Xonar Essence ST/STX and going beyond their already high standards, it offers even more premium audio quality plus easy controls and connectivity for discerning music lovers who needs a good DAC and headphone amplifier to drive the full capabilities of their high-end headphones.\n\n<b>High quality precision audio</b>\n\nXonar Essence STU delivers clean, clear, and low distortion sound with 120dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thanks to exacting hardware design and top-notch component selection.\n\n- Precision clock tuning technology\nXonar Essence STU embeds a precise clock tuning IC that kills jitter prior to signal processing, ensuring the highest fidelity with extensive detail and lively sound imaging.\n\n- Digital-to-analog converter (DAC)\nHigh fidelity Texas Instruments PCM1792A DAC delivers accurate digital-to-analog conversion, sensational audio clarity, and low distortion.\n\n- Audiophile-approved capacitors\nWIMA FKP2 and Nichicon Finegold capacitors deliver balanced and rich sound.\n\n- Asynchronous audio transfer\nAsynchronous USB transfer mode separates unstable and noisy clocks generated by the computer or its USB interface logic, maintaining sync with master clock circuitry on Xonar Essence STU.\n\n- Balanced (or mirrored) PCB layout\nSymmetrical analog output path ensures balanced and truthful representation of all sound sources and minimal crosstalk.\n\n<b>Integrated 600ohm headphone amplifier optimizes sound detail with two gain settings</b>\n\n- Headphone amplifier\nRenowned TPA6120A2 headphone amplifier supports up to 600ohm impedance, driving all headphones available in the market. It empowers your favorite set with dynamic and detailed sound.\n\n- Headphone gain switch\nXonar Essence STU offers readily accessible switching between low and high gain settings, accommodating better listening experiences across a wide range of headphones, from in-ear headsets (typically 16ohm-32ohm) to premium full-size headphones ( up to 600ohm). This is especially useful with the increasing popularity of mobile devices, which normally ship with low impedance/high sensitivity headsets.\n\n<b>Convenient tonal tuning</b>\n\nXonar Essence STU has room for three swappable Op-Amps (operational amplifiers), which you can replace to adjust tonal performance based on personal taste. This open-ended and customizable design is inherited from previous Xonar Essence audio products, and remains true to the seriesâ€™ commitment to accommodating as many audiophile preferences as possible.\n\nTexas Instruments NS-LME49720 and NS-LM4562NA Op-Amps deliver acoustics fine-tuned by audio engineers to support livelier, more detailed, and more spacious sound.\n\n<b>Advanced controls</b>\n\n- By-passing volume jumper switch\nThe included jumper switch re-routes sound and allows Xonar Essence STU to be used as a pre-amplifier in conjunction with a dedicated power amplifier. You can opt to adjust master volume directly on the power amplifier without having to reach Xonar Essence STU controls.\n\n- Selectable DC servo headphone output\nMany music enthusiasts choose to solder a DC servo on their DAC to minimize power-up pop noise on the renowned TPA6120A2 headphone amplifier. The dedicated DC servo on Xonar Essence STU offers a convenient and solder-free alternative.";"120 dB, 10 - 48000 Hz, 1 x 6.3 mm, 2 x RCA, 2 x S/PDIF in (1 x Optical (Toslink)/1 x Coaxial), Aux in 3.5mm";;;"ASUS Xonar Essence STU";2013-05-01;"243.03 USD";images/18262977-2288.jpg
